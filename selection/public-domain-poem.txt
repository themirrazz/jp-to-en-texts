Excerpt from "The Water" by Henry Lawson

[Original Excerpt]
Henry Lawson's "The Water"

Let others make the songs of love
For our young struggling nation;
But I will sing while e'er I live
The Songs of Irrigation;
For while the white man shall beget
The white man's son and daughter,
The two most precious things for us
Shall still be wheat and water.

[Translated Excerpt]
ラソン・ヘンリーの「水」
